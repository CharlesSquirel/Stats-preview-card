## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Media queries

### What I learned

1. I learned how to do a img's mask without set additional div with background and position absolute. Instead the picture tag could have background and then the img with opacity. It save lot of media queries and it's more responsive.
2. I used for the first time aria-hidden attribute.
3. Picture tag with the main img in the img tag, another in source.
4. When I don't use some class in css, then I don't write them in HTML.
